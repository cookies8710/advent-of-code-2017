B = 109 300
C = 126 300
while(true) {
	F = 1
	D = 2
	do {
		E = 2
		do {
			if (E * D == B)
				F = 0
			E++
		} while (E != B)
		D++
	} while (D != B)
	if (F == 0)
		H++
	if (B == C)
		exit
	B += 17
} 


F will be set to 0 when B has E and D as factors
~ F == 1 is equvalent to B is prime

i.e. H is the number of non-primes between 109 300 and 126 300 inclusive which can be written in form (109300 + k * 17) - the answer is 911
